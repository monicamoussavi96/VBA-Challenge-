# VBA-Challenge-
Homework 2 
In this homework assignment, I used VBA scripting in order to anazlyze real stock market data from 2014-2016. I was able to create a script that produced the yearly change in stock price from opening to closing, the percent change in price from opening to closing as well as the total volume of the stock. I also applied conditional formatting in order to highlight the positive and negative changes between opening and closing prices.
